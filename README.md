# WeRateDogs
This is a report on the Data Wrangling efforts for my second project in the ALX-T
Data Analyst Nanodegree Program on Udacity. The aim of the project is to gather &
analyse the data of a Twitter account named @dog_rates. WeRateDogs is a Twitter
account that rates peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
To analyze the data and generate insights, we must first go through a data Wrangling Process to ensure we are
generating a trustworthy analyses and visualizations. 
#### The Data Wrangling Process was divided in stages, these include: 
1. Data Gathering 
2. Data Assessment 
3. Data Cleaning 
4. Data Storage
